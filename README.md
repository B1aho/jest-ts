# Typescript with TDD
This project is designed to help me improve my TDD skills by focusing on writing tests before implementing code. Each functionality is covered with detailed tests to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Project Overview
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **TDD Approach**: Writing tests before implementing functionality

### Practice different TDD techniques:
- Red-Green-Refactor
- Fake it till you make it
- Triangulation
